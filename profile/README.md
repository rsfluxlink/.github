Remote sensing (RS) can help scientists interpret carbon, water, and energy flux measurements at eddy covariance sites by providing contextual information on community composition and vegetation function, as well as scale fluxes globally. Additionally, flux data can inform remote sensing measurements which do not directly measure carbon and water fluxes.

This github repository provides an operational catch all for information, software and other resources to assimilate near-surface remote sensing data with (energy) flux data.
