Remote sensing (RS) can help scientists interpret carbon, water, and energy flux measurements at eddy covariance sites by providing contextual information on community composition and vegetation function, as well as scale fluxes globally. Additionally, flux data can inform remote sensing measurements which do not directly measure carbon and water fluxes.

This github repository provides an operational catch all for information, software and other resources to assimilate near-surface remote sensing data with (energy) fluxes. All communication, code and other materials are public and we would like to remind you of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/rsfluxlink/policies/blob/main/CONDUCT.md).

### Asking for help ⛑️

The working group provides community support through a number of channels. The working group provides a slack channel for rapid chat style communication. To gain access to the Slack channel or get an invite and join the discussion [raise an issue](https://github.com/rsfluxlink/discussions/issues) in the discussion repository (follow the link and punch the green button, and tag either @zoepierrat or @khufkens). In addition, open discussions which require persistence can be found on the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/orgs/rsfluxlink/discussions) above.

## (near-surface) Remote sensing measurements :earth_africa:

This is a list of key resources by partners in order to measure, process and or deal with various forms of near-surface remote sensing from a practical perspective. This covers both acquisition and post-processing protocols.

### Protocols

To ensure interoperability common protocols are helpful. However, we are mindful of people's personal financial, practical and research constraints. Portocols are therefore as well defined as possible, but as flexible as needed. 

### Hyperspectral

### SIF

### LIDAR

### Thermal

## Accessing / pre-processing / data assimilation 📂

> A key part of research is gathering existing data and processing them. In addition, combining data streams is crucial for both intercomparisons and furthering our understanding of both ecosystems and sensor (networks), or remote sensing products alike. Below we link to key software to access, process and assimilate various data streams.
